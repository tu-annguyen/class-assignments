The purpose of this assignment is to create a new and somewhat different List
ADT from the ones in previous assignments in C++. This List will be used to 
perform shuffling operations, and determine how many shuffles are necessary to 
bring a List back into its original order.

Regarding the shuffle() prototype specified in pa4.pdf, I renamed the List D
parameter to A for my own convenience.

This assignment includes the following files:
    README
    Makefile
    List.h
    List.cpp
    ListTest.cpp
    Shuffle.cpp

Build:
    $ make

Run:
    $ ./Shuffle <deck-size>

Clean:
    $ make clean
